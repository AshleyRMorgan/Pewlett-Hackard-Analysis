# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis


## **Overview of the Analysis**
The purpose of this analysis was to analyze the status of upcoming retiring employees. This analysis was broken down into multiple sets of data to display the number of retiring employees by title, by department, and overall number of retiring employees. There was also a request to find the employees who are eligible to be a mentor.

## **Results**
     - The first query created resulted in a data set that contained all employees 
     within the employees table that have a birthday between 01-01-1952 and 12-31-1955.

     - The second query used the data above to filter out the employees who are no longer with the 
     company and have a to_date of 01-01-9999. This date causes the data to display only current employees.
